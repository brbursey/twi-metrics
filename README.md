# twi-metrics
Name to be changed, maybe

## Setup
Clone this repo with 

`git clone https://github.com/brbursey/twi-metrics.git`

Youll need to get the dev environment api key and secret (more to work on that)

Run `make run` in the terminal to build the docker containers. Theres not much there at the moment..

## Using
All we got rn is authorization. 

You can authorize the app to use your twitter account with `localhost:5000/authorize`. 

This will let you start using the API
